# Multi-Agent Research Intelligence Pipeline

A locally-running multi-agent system for deep, interdisciplinary research with only 3 dependencies. Give it a research question, it excavates the intellectual history, maps the gaps, proposes approaches, evaluates their feasibility, synthesises a research narrative, and produces a final document. You stay in control through three mandatory review breaks.

The system produces a clear and consice understanding map in which the user can grasp all the necessary knowledge given a problem. A clear artifact can be found here:
[understanding_map](https://github.com/anvix9/basis_research_agents/blob/main/artifacts/RUN-20260407-022355-242D_understanding_map.md)

A derived but not the objective of the system is some research-briefs, or blog-posts alike products, one example is shared with the following:

## What it does

This is version **1.0.0**, and it is meant to improve over time.

The pipeline runs **10 specialized agents in sequence**, each building on the output of the previous one. It pulls information simultaneously from academic databases, book catalogs, and web search. The system distinguishes between what the field has firmly established, what has been tried and abandoned, where the real gaps are, and what might be worth proposing next. The design keeps a **human-in-the-loop**, with three review points where I can evaluate and redirect the process before the pipeline continues.

I built this pipeline mostly for myself and for my own work and research. When you do research with AI, it is very easy to lose control of the information that appears — whether it should be trusted, how solid it is, or what its real motivation is. Since I mainly do fundamental research, I cannot afford to navigate with uncertain information, unclear motives, or spend my time simply verifying papers suggested by a model which most of the time can easily skip deeper contents.

For that reason, I built this multi-agent system (10 agents for now) that maps, from my perspective, the cognitive tasks required to make an investigation rigorous. The diagram is shown below. I also implemented hard breaks where I manually review the major steps offline. This is the moment where I read, learn, and decide on the trajectory of the problem. Since the system tends to retrieve seminal works and major contributions, by the time I go through these breaks and read the material and analysis it finds, I usually have a clear understanding of the problem situation at hand, and only a few additional steps are needed afterward, to have a clear taste of the environment and current **real** gaps. In that way, I remain in control of the process and do not loose my intellectual contribution. 

```
Social → [Break 0] → Grounder → Historian → Gaper
       → [Break 1] → Vision → Theorist → Rude → Synthesizer
       → [Break 2] → Thinker → Scribe
```

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| **Social** | Collects current papers and books from 8 academic sources |
| **Grounder** | Decomposes the problem into sub-questions, excavates intellectual origins, finds seminal works and books |
| **Historian** | Builds a chronological map of how the field developed — including dead ends |
| **Gaper** | Identifies and classifies all meaningful gaps (empirical, conceptual, methodological, theoretical) |
| **Vision** | Draws logical implications from everything established so far |
| **Theorist** | Proposes concrete, scoped, falsifiable approaches anchored in the gaps and implications |
| **Rude** | Evaluates every proposal with empirical rigour — identifies the weakest link in each |
| **Synthesizer** | Produces the unified research narrative and sharpens the original problem |
| **Thinker** | Opens genuinely new research directions beyond existing proposals |
| **Scribe** | Writes the final document in the format you request (blog post, research brief, literature review, paper section, grant background) |

## Human-in-the-loop breaks

Three mandatory review breaks where the pipeline stops, produces a structured summary document, and waits for your instructions before continuing.

- **Break 0** — confirm which themes and sources to search
- **Break 1** — review foundations, timeline, and gaps; direct the proposal phase
- **Break 2** — review proposals and synthesis; specify the output format

---

## Sources

| Source | Type | Key needed |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAlex | Academic papers | Required (free) — [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api) |
| arXiv | Preprints | None — uses official `arxiv` library |
| PubMed | Biomedical | Optional (free) — 3x rate boost with key |
| Semantic Scholar | Academic papers | Optional (free) |
| CORE | Open access aggregator | Optional (free) |
| PhilPapers | Philosophy index | Optional (free) — skipped gracefully without key |

## Semantic concept expansion

Before searching, the pipeline translates your research question into its full conceptual territory using a local ConceptNet database (184MB, 2.29 million English edges). A three-layer process term extraction, ConceptNet neighbourhood, LLM synthesis, determines which of the 23 configured research themes to activate.

This means a question like *"What is the place of AI in human life?"* automatically activates philosophy of mind, anthropology, sociology, ethics, cognitive science, history, and law — without you having to specify them.

---

## LLM routing

The pipeline uses Claude as the primary model with automatic fallback:

1. Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary for all heavy reasoning agents)
2. Claude Haiku 4.5 (lighter agents and fallback)
3. Ollama `deepseek-r1:8b` (local fallback if Claude API unavailable)
4. Ollama `llama3.2:3b` (final local fallback)

Per-agent token limits prevent truncation: Grounder and Theorist get 16,000 tokens; Historian and Synthesizer get 10,000.

## Output formats

Specified in your Break 2 instruction file:

```
SCRIBE OUTPUT: blog_post | audience: general public
SCRIBE OUTPUT: literature_review | audience: academic peers
SCRIBE OUTPUT: research_brief | audience: policy makers
SCRIBE OUTPUT: paper_section | audience: journal reviewers
SCRIBE OUTPUT: grant_background | audience: funding committee
SCRIBE OUTPUT: internal_memo | audience: research team
```

Prose formats (blog post, brief, memo) output `.md`. Academic formats (literature review, paper section, grant background) output `.tex`.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anvix9/basis_research_agents

## Run

```bash
python3 main.py run --problem "What is the place of AI in human life?"
```

Resume an interrupted run:

```bash
python3 main.py run --problem "..." --run-id RUN-20260330-203603-3283 --resume
```

Other commands:

```bash
python3 main.py collect          # passive scan of all themes (run twice weekly)
python3 main.py recheck          # check all saved links are still alive
python3 main.py status --run-id RUN-XXX
python3 main.py runs             # list recent runs
python3 main.py bank             # review Grounder's proposed new themes
python3 main.py keys             # check API key status
```

---

## ConceptNet local database

The concept expansion layer works without ConceptNet (falls back to LLM-only) but is significantly richer with it. One-time setup:

```bash
# Download the raw dump (~1.5GB compressed)
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/conceptnet/downloads/2019/edges/conceptnet-assertions-5.7.0.csv.gz

# Dry run — test filters on first 2 million lines without writing
python3 tools/import_conceptnet.py --input conceptnet-assertions-5.7.0.csv.gz --dry-run

# Full import (~30-60 min depending on disk speed)
python3 tools/import_conceptnet.py --input conceptnet-assertions-5.7.0.csv.gz

# Verify
python3 tools/import_conceptnet.py --stats
```

Output: `db/conceptnet.db` — 184MB, 2.29M English edges, indexed for fast lookup.

---

## Passive collection (optional cron)

Run Social twice weekly to build up the source database before any specific problem is submitted:

```bash
# Add to crontab
0 6 * * 1,4 cd /path/to/pipeline && python3 main.py collect
```

---

## Database

All pipeline data is stored in `db/pipeline.db` (SQLite). 11 tables:

`runs` · `sources` · `gaps` · `implications` · `proposals` · `evaluations` · `syntheses` · `directions` · `artifacts` · `seminal_bank` · `dead_links`

Full schema documented in [TECHNICAL.md](./TECHNICAL.md).
